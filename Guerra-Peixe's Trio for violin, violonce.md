by Frederico Barros

The year was 1960 and Brazilian composer César Guerra-Peixe submitted his *Trio for violin, violoncello and piano* to a contest held by the Brazilian Ministry of Education's radio station.<1> The piece is illustrative of Guerra-Peixe's output in the period, but at the same time some of its specificities offer interesting points of discussion. In fact, from the modal techniques employed and explicit nationalism to the clear structure and tightly-knit thematic work, the *Trio* shows how Guerra-Peixe positioned himself in the debate about Brazilian music at the time. Some old-school motivic analysis may help us get a clearer understanding of what is at stake here.

The opening *Sonata Allegro* begins with material related to the Brazilian northeast in the way the Lydian mode is employed (A1)<2>, immediately followed by its Dorian version (A1'):

The rhythm played by the piano is hard to pinpoint, but the composer himself would later state that there elements of the *berimbau* in the piece,<12> so it's very likely that this is one of them, with its triplets played in an alternating major second. An increase in chromaticism and polyphonic activity marks the transition from A1' to A2, then reaching the climax of the first group through a series of sequences and imitations. Derived from the cell *c* in A1, A2 also marks the passage from D dorian (A1') to F# minor (A2), then leading to B1, in B dorian. Finally, B2 brings back the Lydian sound of A1 - to which it shows other interesting resemblances[^15] -, but now in the key of A.

At this point it becomes clear how the thematic work, the modal relations and the tonal plan intertwine. The exposition went from D to F#, then to B and finally to A, which not only has the character of a closing theme, but also is centered around the dominant of the main key. Furthermore, from the first group to the second - the foundational polarity of sonata form - the piece descends a minor third, as if going from major to relative minor, but here making a homologous move from Lydian to Dorian. As we can see, the modalism present in the *Trio* takes over the role of the tonal relations in a conventional *Sonata Allegro*, which in turn serves as a point of entrance into a significant aspect of the piece: Guerra-Peixe stayed rooted in traditional principles while infusing them with material from other traditions, following the *sonata allegro* tradition by the book - at least in its 19th Century version<10> -, but employing material of recognizably Brazilian character.

This raises the question of whether we'd better not take all this at face value...

Some years later, Guerra-Peixe would affirm that he wrote the *Trio* in a deliberately academic fashion, hoping it would make it fare better in the contest.[^4]<3> Granted, we cannot know for sure if the *Sonata Allegro* was actually a requirement or if Guerra-Peixe deemed it a safer bet. Furthermore, the elements indicated in the analysis above are all fairly common in the Western tradition, usually being considered indicators of good compositional technique and constructive rigour, even if a bit dated.<9> Nonetheless, albeit very often present, these elements tend to be considerably subtler in other works of the composer, suggesting that he saw the judges as possessing a rather conventional taste.

Guerra-Peixe tended to show off his knowledge of Brazilian regional cultures by substituting not only melodic ideas and rhythms - which at that time were common currency for nationalists worldwide -, but also structures and forms he learned during his field researches in the countryside<4> for traditional elements of Western music. An eloquent example is the String Quartet no. 2, from 1958, where one finds out that the first movement may superficially sound like a multi-thematic *sonata allegro*, then start wondering if it isn't a rondo only to finally, with some luck, find out that the composer employed the form of the *cateretê* from São Paulo. To make matters even more complicated, we are not dealing with a song form or anything like that, but with **a manifestation more akin to a ritual or a party**, the sequential development of which is mirrorred in the piece.<11>

Regardless of the fact that Guerra-Peixe may have mis-evaluated the jury (he received the second prize and the winning piece, by Marlos Nobre, cannot be said to be strikingly traditionalist), the *Trio* reveals what Guerra-Peixe *thought of* them - and, by extension, of the other nationalists to some extent.

Born in 1914, Guerra-Peixe's formative years were marked by the rise of the first Modernist generation - that of Villa-Lobos, born in 1887). It was a period of both aesthetic modernization and of coming to terms with the idea of a national art, and throughout the following two decades this two-fold task would converge, being modern and sounding Brazilian eventually becoming interdependent. In this very same process, the first modernists would oppose those who came before with charges of europeism and traditionalism, but slowly sliding into being themselves the new established (in both senses) tradition. At least that's how many of their successors saw them. To add insult to injury, this took place through their cooptation by the Getúlio Vargas regime.[^30]

In terms of music, they went from vanguard to nationalist vanguard and then to the new establishment. To put it bluntly, younger composers such as Guerra-Peixe or Santoro would see the nationalist modernists as uninteresting, repetitive and in many cases as plain sellouts. During the 1940s Guerra-Peixe joined the *Música Viva* group, centered around german composer Hans-Joachim Koellreutter, and began his twelve-tone period, first radically opposing any form of nationalism and then gradually starting to experiment with combining the two trends. His stint with dodecaphony lasted until the end of that decade, when questions about how and by whom his music would be received and its social utility started bugging him. Without getting too much into the specifics,<5> Guerra-Peixe plunged himself both into the Brazilian countryside and in a compositional crisis, eventually leading him to abandon the twelve-tone technique for good in favor of a music that fed heavily from his proto-ethnomusicological researches.<6> Having himself joined the nationalist bandwagon now, he would criticize his peers by turning their own principles against them,<7> with charges of poor knowledge of the Brazilian popular traditions and lack of compositional chops.

Thus, the meticulous melodic construction and compositional prowess (in the traditional sense) shown in the *Trio* may be seen as a deliberate act in that context. Guerra-Peixe considered the jury conventional both on the aesthetic and the technical side, and the comparison with his second string quartet is instructive: in terms of nationalism, Guerra-Peixe would more or less align with the jury, although usually in a much more nuanced and complex fashion; but with regards to the technical side things tended to get a bit fuzzier, as he would often derive procedures from the folkloric forms he'd study, risking a relative alienation of an audience more atuned with the Western canon. That's much less visible in the *Trio*, where he would try to create a work suitable to the jury's taste deviating from his usual practice in its more visible aspects. The constructive rigour is there, but a proper *sonata allegro* is created, not some alternative form<13>; the modal elements scream Brazil (at least to someone acquainted with the country's nationalist composers), but then below the surface they put structural forces into motion; rhythms from Bahia serve as accompaniment to melodic and modal elements from Pernambuco, blurring regional frontiers<14>.  


A conclusão é que ele tentou forçar ainda mais os elementos tirados do nacionalismo para criar uma obra convencional na superfície, mas marcadamente ligada a suas referências e interesses num plano mais profundo

<2> Showing why these materials are related to specific regions of Brazil is in itself a complex endeavor, let alone in a limited space like this. However it is possible to let the composer himself speak, as he wrote some pioneering studies on Brazilian "folklore" during the 1950s, not coincidentally the period in which he developed his nationalist style. In **NOME DO ARTIGO**, Guerra-Peixe presents examples that bear clear resemblance - both melodic and rhythmic - to what we are to find in both B2 and A1, given the close relations between them.
