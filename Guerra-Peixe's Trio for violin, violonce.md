The year was 1960 and Brazilian composer César Guerra-Peixe submitted his *Trio for violin, violoncello and piano* to a contest held by the Brazilian Ministry of Education's radio station.<1> The piece is illustrative of Guerra-Peixe's output in the period, but at the same time some of its specificities offer interesting points of discussion. In fact, from the modal techniques employed and explicit nationalism to the clear structure and tightly-knit thematic work, the *Trio* shows how Guerra-Peixe positioned himself in the debate about Brazilian music at the time. Some old-school motivic analysis may help us get a clearer understanding of what is at stake here.

The opening *Sonata Allegro* begins with material related to the Brazilian northeast in the way the Lydian mode is employed<2>, immediately followed by its Dorian version (A1 and A1', respectively):

An increase in chromaticism and polyphonic activity marks the transition from A1' to A2, then reaching the climax of the first group through a series of sequences and imitations. Derived from the cell *c* in A1, A2 also marks the passage from D dorian (A1') to F# minor (A2), then leading to B1, in B dorian. Finally, B2 brings back the Lydian sound of A1 - to which it shows other interesting resemblances[^15] - but now in the key of A.

At this point it becomes clear how the thematic work, the modal relations and the tonal plan intertwine. The exposition went from D to F#, then to B and finally to A, which not only has the character of a closing theme, but also is centered around the dominant of the main key. Furthermore, from the first group to the second - the foundational polarity of sonata form - the piece descends a minor third, as if going from major to relative minor, but here making a homologous move from Lydian to Dorian. As we can see, the modalism present in the *Trio* takes over the role of the tonal relations in a conventional *Sonata Allegro* **and this serves as a point of entrance into a more significant aspect of this piece**, thus raising the question of whether we had better not take all this at face value. Some years later, Guerra-Peixe would affirm that he wrote the *Trio* in a deliberately academic fashion, hoping it would make it fare better in the contest.[^4]<3>

Granted, we cannot know for sure if the *Sonata Allegro* was actually a requirement or if Guerra-Peixe deemed it a safer bet. Moreover, the elements indicated in the analysis above are all fairly common in the Western tradition and are in fact usually considered indicators of good compositional technique and constructive rigour, even if a bit dated.<9> Nonetheless, albeit very often present, these elements tend to be considerably subtler in other works of the composer, suggesting that he saw the judges as possessing a rather conventional taste.

Guerra-Peixe tended to show off his knowledge of Brazilian regional cultures by substituting melodic ideas, modes or even structures and forms he learned during his field researches in the countryside<4> for traditional elements of Western music. An eloquent example is the String Quartet no. 2, from 1958, where one finds out that the first movement may superficially sound like a multi-thematic *sonata allegro*, then start wondering if it isn't a rondo only to finally, with some luck, find out that the composer employed the form of the *cateretê* from São Paulo. To make matters even more complicated, the folkloric form in question is not a type of song or anything like that, but in fact a ritual in itself, the sequence of which is mirrorred in the piece.

Regardless of the fact that Guerra-Peixe may have mis-evaluated the jury - he received the second prize and the winning piece, the one by Marlos Nobre, cannot be said to be strikingly traditionalist -, there is something to be said about his position in that moment with regards to the debate about Brazilian music.

Born in 1914, Guerra-Peixe's formative years were marked by the first Modernist generation - that of Villa-Lobos and Mario de Andrade. This is a period of both aesthetic modernization and of coming to terms with the idea of a national art and this two-fold task would start to converge into one and the same enterprise, as being modern and sounding national would eventually become interdependent. The first modernists would oppose those who came before them with charges of europeism and traditionalism, but in the following three decades they would subtly but surely slide into being themselves the representants of the new established (in both senses) tradition. At least that's how many of their successors saw them. To add insult to injury, this took place through their cooptation by the Getúlio Vargas regime.[^30]

From vanguard to vanguard nationalism and then to the new establishment, younger artists such as Guerra-Peixe would see the modernists as uninteresting, repetitive and in many cases as sellouts who would align with Vargas in search of opportunities. The 1940s is when Guerra-Peixe joins the Música Viva group, centered around german composer H-J Koellreutter, who was starting to teach the twelve-tone technique to young composers looking for the latest compositional trends in Europe. Guerra-Peixe's stint with dodecaphony lasted until the end of that decade, when questions about how and by whom his music would be received and its social utility started bugging him. I won't get into the specifics of this period,<5> but Guerra-Peixe plunged himself both into the Brazilian countryside and in a compositional crisis that would eventually lead him to abandon the twelve-tone technique for good in favor of a nationalist approach to composition that would feed heavily from such proto-ethnomusicological researches.<6> He would criticize his nationalist peers, turning their own principles and stances against them<7> with charges of poor knowledge of the Brazilian popular traditions, and lack of compositional chops.

Thus, the meticulous melodic construction and compositional prowess (in the traditional sense) shown in the *Trio* may be seen as a deliberate act in the context of the contest. Guerra-Peixe considered the jury conventional both on the aesthetic and the technical side, and the comparison with his second string quartet is instructive: in terms of nationalism, Guerra-Peixe would more or less align with the jury, although usually in a much more nuanced and complex fashion; but with regards to the technical side things tended to get a bit fuzzier, as he would often derive procedures from the folkloric forms he'd study, risking a relative alienation of an audience more atuned with the Western canon. That's something the is much less visible in the *Trio*.

Mixing elements obtained from different traditions and styles in the same work is entirely cogent with Guerra-Peixe's more general attitude towards the folklore. If he would create thematic material inspired in the Brazilian north-east and work it with a rhythmic figuration from São Paulo, then why not bring in tonal elements from the urban popular songs he dealt with in his day gig at the radio station or even procedures and chordal structures from the concert music of his day?

In fact, even in post-tonal settings, tonal elements are very frequently found in the concert music of that time, especially in points of articulation of the form, such as the minor 9th chord that closes the development section in the *Trio*'s first movement (**compasso X**). As for the various points of contact between his music and that of the Western concert tradition of his time, the way he managed voice leading and the structures generated through it are, I believe, more than enough to illustrate the point.<8>





Neste sentido, Guerra-Peixe estava trabalhando bem próximo da prática comum da época -- e se por vezes pode ser difícil percebê-lo, isso se deve em boa medida ao próprio efeito da "narrativa da continuidade" discutida no início do capítulo, que colocou muito mais ênfase nos compositores que trabalharam na tradição atonal-serialista.

onde parece haver maior distanciamento da parte de Guerra-Peixe em relação a essa espécie de prática comum do meio do século XX[^150] é nas formas com que o material obtido na cultura popular era tratado, o que se revela na relação entre modalismo, tonalismo e práticas pós-tonais, mas também no próprio trabalho composicional, que Faria (2000) chamou, a partir dos termos do próprio Guerra-Peixe, de "estilização do folclore", assuntos que serão tratados no próximo capítulo.


A conclusão é que ele tentou forçar ainda mais os elementos tirados do nacionalismo para criar uma obra convencional na superfície, mas marcadamente ligada a suas referências e interesses num plano mais profundo

<2> Showing why these materials are related to specific regions of Brazil is in itself a complex endeavor, let alone in a limited space like this. However it is possible to let the composer himself speak, as he wrote some pioneering studies on Brazilian "folklore" during the 1950s, not coincidentally the period in which he developed his nationalist style. In **NOME DO ARTIGO**, Guerra-Peixe presents examples that bear clear resemblance - both melodic and rhythmic - to what we are to find in both B2 and A1, given the close relations between them.

<8> A lot could be said about the relations between Guerra-Peixe's harmonic thinking and Hindemith's *Unterweisung im Tonsatz*, but I am forced by space constraints to refrain from entering the topic. A glance at the Brazilian composer's little book - first given to his students in the form of handout material - is enough to at least sparke interest on it.
<9> There is a wealth of material discussing the implicit conservatism in valuing these things and how the so-called neoclassicism re-established these parameters as valid at least to a certain extent.
