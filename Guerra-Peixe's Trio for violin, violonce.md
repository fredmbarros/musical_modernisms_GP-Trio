Guerra-Peixe's academic Trio

by Frederico Barros

The year was 1960 and Brazilian composer César Guerra-Peixe submitted his *Trio for violin, violoncello and piano*<1> to a contest held by the Brazilian Ministry of Education's radio station.<2> On the surface, the piece is illustrative of Guerra-Peixe's output in the period, but some of its specificities offer interesting points of discussion. Overall, we can say that, from the modal techniques employed and explicit nationalism to the clear structure and tightly-knit thematic work, the *Trio* shows how Guerra-Peixe positioned himself in the debate about Brazilian music at the time. Some old-school motivic analysis may help us better understand what this means.

The opening *sonata-allegro* begins with material related to the Brazilian northeast<2.1> in the way the Lydian mode is employed (A1, see example 1), immediately followed by its Dorian version (A1'):

Example 1: GUERRA-PEIXE - Trio for violin, violoncello and piano, 1st mov., measures 1-11.

The origin of the piano part is hard to pinpoint, but Guerra-Peixe would later state that "there are elements of the *berimbau*" in the piece,<12> and the rhythmic figures and alternating notes a major second apart in the highest voice heard here can certainly be associated with it.

An increase in chromaticism and polyphonic activity marks the transition from A1' to A2, then reaching the climax of the first group through a series of sequences and imitations. Derived from the cell *c* in A1, A2 also marks the passage from D dorian (A1') to F# minor (A2), then leading to B1, in B dorian. Finally, B2, in the key of A, has the character of a sonata exposition closing theme and brings back the Lydian sound of A1, to which it shows other interesting resemblances[^15]:

Example 2: GUERRA-PEIXE - Trio for violin, violoncello and piano, 1st mov., measures 70-74.

The exposition went from D to F#, then to B and finally to A, and from the first group to the second - the foundational polarity of sonata form - the piece descends a minor third, as if going from major to relative minor, but here making a homologous move from D Lydian to B Dorian. As we can see, despite B2 being in the dominant region, the modalism present in the *Trio* takes over the role of the tonal relations in a conventional *sonata-allegro*, which in turn serves as an entry point into a significant aspect of the piece: Guerra-Peixe stayed rooted in principles from the Western tradition while infusing them with material of different origins, following the *sonata* procedures by the book,<10> but employing material of recognizably Brazilian character.

This raises the question of whether we'd better not take all this at face value...

Some years later, Guerra-Peixe would affirm that he wrote the *Trio* in a deliberately academic fashion, hoping it would make it fare better in the contest.[^4]<3> Granted, we cannot know for sure if the *sonata-allegro* was a requirement or if Guerra-Peixe deemed it a safer bet. Furthermore, the elements indicated above are all fairly common in the Western tradition, usually being considered indicators of good compositional technique, even if a bit dated.<9> Nonetheless, albeit very often present, these elements tend to be considerably subtler in other works of the composer, suggesting that he saw the judges as possessing a rather conventional taste.

Guerra-Peixe tended to show off his knowledge of Brazilian regional cultures by ditching traditional elements of Western music for not only melodic ideas and rhythms - which at that time were common currency for nationalists worldwide -, but also structures and forms he learned during trips he took to the countryside.<4> An eloquent example is the first movement of his second *String Quartet*, from 1958: at first one may believe it to be a somewhat odd *sonata-allegro*, then start wondering if it isn't in fact a rondo only to finally, with some luck, find out that the composer employed the form of the *cateretê* from São Paulo. To make matters even more complicated, we are not dealing with a song form or equivalent, but with a manifestation more akin to a ritual, whose sequential development is mirrored in the piece.<11>

Born in 1914, Guerra-Peixe's formative years were marked by the rise of the first Modernist generation. It was a period of both aesthetic modernization and of coming to terms with the idea of a national art, and throughout the following two decades this two-fold task would converge. In this very same process, the first modernists would oppose those who came before with charges of europeism and traditionalism, but slowly sliding into being themselves the new established (in both senses) tradition. At least that's how many of their successors saw them. To add insult to injury, this took place through their cooptation by the Getúlio Vargas dictatorial regime.[^30]

To put it bluntly, younger composers such as Guerra-Peixe would see the nationalist modernists as uninteresting, repetitive and in many cases as plain sellouts. During the 1940s Guerra-Peixe joined the *Música Viva* group, centered around german composer Hans-Joachim Koellreutter, and began his twelve-tone period, first radically opposing any form of nationalism and then gradually starting to experiment with combining the two trends. His stint with dodecaphony lasted until the end of that decade, when questions about how and by whom his music would be received and its social utility started bugging him. Guerra-Peixe then plunged both into the Brazilian countryside and in a creative crisis, eventually leading him to abandon the twelve-tone technique for good in favor of a music that fed heavily from his proto-ethnomusicological researches.<6> Having joined the nationalist bandwagon now, he would criticize his peers by turning their own principles against them,<7> with charges of poor knowledge of the Brazilian traditions and lack of compositional chops.

Thus, the meticulous melodic construction and compositional prowess (in the traditional sense) shown in the *Trio* may be seen as a deliberate act in that context. Not getting into value judgements, regardless of the fact that Guerra-Peixe may have mis-evaluated the jury (he received the second prize and the winning piece, by Marlos Nobre, cannot be said to be conservative), the *Trio* reveals that Guerra-Peixe considered the jury conventional both on the aesthetic and the technical side. If in terms of nationalism he would more or less align with them - although usually in a more nuanced and complex fashion -, with regards to the technical side things tended to get fuzzier. Guerra-Peixe would often derive procedures from folkloric forms, risking a relative alienation of an audience more atuned with the Western canon. That's much less visible in the *Trio*, where he would deviate from his usual practice in some aspects. We won't find some alternative form here, but a proper *sonata-allegro*, and as such the thematic material is orderly presented. At the same time, rhythms from Bahia serve as accompaniment to melodic elements from Pernambuco, purposefully blurring geographic frontiers.<14> The modal elements sound Brazilian, but below the surface they put very Western structural forces into motion; and so on. This is not to say that Guerra-Peixe would otherwise *always* avoid the so-called common practice, that is, Western concert music tradition - be it modern or classic-romantic. Timbre, harmony, developmental procedures, most aspects of the Western thought about music would be to some extent impacted by the folkloristic investigations he engaged in from the 1950s on. Threading the line that separated his own aesthetic demands and the taste of an imagined jury, he ended up exposing some shortcomings of the modernist project he was himself stumbling upon, but couldn't quite fathom at the time, touching on things we are still today grappling with: competing and/or complimentary theories of form, discourse and dramaticity, amounting to alternative ways of thinking about music itself.

<2.1> Showing why these materials are related to specific regions of Brazil is in itself a complex endeavor, let alone in a limited space like this. However it is possible to let the composer himself speak, as he wrote some pioneering studies on Brazilian "folklore" during the 1950s, not coincidentally the period in which he developed his nationalist style. In **Os Cabocolinhos do Recife**, Guerra-Peixe presents examples very similar to both B2 and A1.
